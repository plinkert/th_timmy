Generic SIEM Query - Manual Execution
=====================================

Description: Generic query template for SIEM tools that are not specifically supported.
Adapt this query to match your SIEM tool's query language.

Query Template:
--------------
Search for events where:
- Time range: Last 7 days
- Field: action contains "suspicious_pattern"
- Field: user is not empty
- Field: host is not empty

Sort by: timestamp (descending)
Limit: 1000 results

Example Adaptations:
-------------------

For QRadar:
SELECT * FROM events WHERE action LIKE '%suspicious_pattern%' 
AND startTime >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7' DAY
ORDER BY startTime DESC
LIMIT 1000

For ArcSight:
action contains "suspicious_pattern" AND startTime >= NOW() - 7d
| sort startTime desc
| head 1000

For LogRhythm:
SELECT * FROM Log WHERE Action LIKE '%suspicious_pattern%'
AND DateOccurred >= DATEADD(day, -7, GETDATE())
ORDER BY DateOccurred DESC
LIMIT 1000

Instructions:
-------------
1. Identify your SIEM tool's query language
2. Adapt the query template above to match your tool's syntax
3. Replace "suspicious_pattern" with the actual pattern you're looking for
4. Adjust the time range (default: 7 days)
5. Execute the query in your SIEM tool
6. Export results as CSV or JSON
7. Save the file with a descriptive name
