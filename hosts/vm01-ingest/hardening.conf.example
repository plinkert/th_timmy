# DEPRECATED: Hardening Configuration
#
# This file is deprecated. Hardening configuration has been moved to
# the central configs/config.yml file.
#
# Please configure hardening settings in:
#   configs/config.yml
#
# See configs/config.example.yml for the new structure:
#   hardening:
#     ssh:
#       port: 22
#       timeout: 300
#     firewall:
#       allowed_network: ""
#     vm01:
#       collector_ports: ""
#       enable_auditd: false
#
# The harden_vm01.sh script will automatically read from configs/config.yml.
# This file is kept for reference only and will be removed in a future version.
